# RMIT University Online Systems' Parsing Library

### Disclaimer

1. This library ***is NOT*** a illegal hacking tool. It's fully designed for computer science educational and research purposes, which can only used for reading personal data. Feel free to fork it, improve it  and modify it. But please remember, don't do evil! **Do not VOILATE THE REGULATIONS AND THE LAWS!** See here for more details: [Acceptable use of information and communications technology resources policy](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=n7pij8ia7xqcz).  

2. This library is an ***unofficial*** opensource project, based on LGPLv3 licence. 

3. So far, it still relies on the cookies database from Chrome or Firefox browser, as it needs the RMIT Central Authentication System (CAS) login tokens (for logging in only). As a result, this library needs root/Administrator privileges to access the database. 
4. This library is being developed and tested on macOS 10.12 + Python 3.5
5. It's so far still very, very simple and naive.
